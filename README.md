N741 Spring 2018 - Homework 7 Key

**NOTE:** For Homework 7 it was **IMPORTANT** to keep the code used for the examples shown for the `cesd` separate from the code for the answers done for the `mcs`. Otherwise the later R code chunks that depended on objects created in earlier code chunks to get mixed up between the models for the `cesd` and those for the `mcs`. So, in this Github repository for the Homework 7 ANSWER KEY, I have provided both a simgle RMD file that renamed the variables in each sequential code chunk to keep track of the model outputs for the `cesd` separate from those for the `mcs`.AND an example of separating the code out between 1 RMD for the `cesd` models and one other RMD file for the `mcs` models. Either will work.

* RMD file with code for both the `cesd` and `mcs` models
* RMD file with code for the `cesd` models
* RMD file with code for the `mcs` models
